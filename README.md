## üìù Project Description

The goal of PomoVibes is to create a focus tool that you *want* to use. Instead of a sterile, generic timer, PomoVibes lets you choose your "vibe"‚Äîwhether it's the calm of a forest, the gentle patter of rain, or the vastness of space. Each vibe changes the entire aesthetic of the application, from the color palette to the animated background and ambient sound, creating an immersive focus environment.

## üåü Core Features

- **Functional Pomodoro Timer**: Standard Work, Short Break, and Long Break cycles to structure your focus sessions.
- **Vibe Selector**: Choose from multiple "vibes" like Forest, Rain, Space, Ocean, and more.
- **Dynamic Color Themes**: The entire UI color palette instantly changes to match your chosen vibe.
- **Live Animated Backgrounds**: Built with `tsparticles` for beautiful, lightweight, and interactive background animations.
- **Ambient Background Sounds**: Optional, soft background sounds that match the vibe to help you tune out distractions.
- **Polished & Responsive UI**: A clean, "glassmorphism" design that looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.

## üíª Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [React](https://reactjs.org/) (with Vite for a lightning-fast build tool)
- **Styling**: Pure CSS with dynamic CSS Variables
- **Animations**: [Tsparticles](https://particles.js.org/) for interactive particle animations
